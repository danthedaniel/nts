A NES emulator written in C.

I started this project as a way to learn more about hardware and assembly. It
also seems like a right of passage, given how many times individuals have made
NES emulators.

**This is a WIP and currently does not actually do anything**

**Installation**

```bash
sudo apt-get install libgtk-3-dev
```
